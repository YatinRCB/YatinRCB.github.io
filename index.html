 <p>
 The first sketch shows an illustrated idea of what the bike share app will look like when you open it up. It will have a login/register 
  page followed by payment info and a student ID number. It will also have a UI showing how many bikes are available at certain bike stations. The second
  sketch shows more or less of the same things as the first one but also has a page for the user profile and settings. In the settings menu you can access 
  messages, payment information, past trips, billing statements, and password change. Lastly, the final sketch builds off the ideas of the first two but
  also includes a map and a bus schedule for user convenience.

 This is a super simple display of what individual parts we need in our college BikeShare app. I plan to include a login page, find available transport page, a membership page, and a user settings display.
